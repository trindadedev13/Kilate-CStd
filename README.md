# Kilate-CStd
- Just my implementation of the C Standard Library, this project is mainly for my learning.
## Attention
- I cannot guarantee that there will always be implementations for all architectures, my device is AARCH64.
## Build
### 1. Run buildscript
```
ruby build.rb
```
### 2. Done
- For now this project is not a library, it is just a CLI project, so when you run the script it will just compile and run the project.
- The script will automatically figure out your architecture and build the correct files.
